# DReaMeR - Dynamic Readaptation and Memory Retention

### This project was done as a course project for the course CS771: Introduction to Machine Learning, under Prof. Piyush Rai, IIT Kanpur.

## Installation  

To install all the dependencies required for this project, use the `requirements.txt` file. Follow the steps below:  

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or above installed.  
2. Install `pip` if it is not already available.  
3. Run the following command in your terminal:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Ensure datasets are correctly loaded in the required structure before running the notebook.
* We *strongly recommend* the following directory structure
  ```
  - main
  | -- extracted_feature
  | -- dataset
  | -- venv (if using one)
  | -- LwP[MAIN].ipynb
  | -- ...
  ```
  where `...` of course represents the other `.py` files in this repo. Note the folder name `extracted_feature`


`LwP[MAIN].ipynb` is our main file. The file is sufficiently self-contained so far as the project is concerned. Ensure you have `dataset` and `extracted_feature` in the same directory as the `.ipynb`.

## Overview

The project addresses countering unseen domains in Machine Learning models. Traditional classifiers tend to overfit the data they're "provided" due to sampling bias. For example, models that fail to identify newer strains of SARS-CoV-2 correctly. Even if the training set is diverse, the same model may fail on data drawn from the same dataset but with a different probability distribution.

This can be mitigated by selectively training the model on confident samples and even duplicating those samples with small random noise to increase the model's confidence in that locale. We attempt to implement this novel idea presented by Liu, et al. (2023) in [*Deja vu: Continual Model Generalization for Unseen Domains*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10418)
