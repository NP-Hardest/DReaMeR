# DReaMeR - Dynamic Readaptation and Memory Retention

### A CS771 Course Project

## Installation  

To install all the dependencies required for this project, use the `requirements.txt` file. Follow the steps below:  

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or above installed.  
2. Install `pip` if it is not already available.  
3. Run the following command in your terminal:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Ensure datasets are correctly loaded in the required structure before running the notebook.
* We *strongly recommend* the following directory structure
  ```
  - main
  | -- extracted_feature
  | -- dataset
  | -- venv (if using one)
  | -- LwP[MAIN].ipynb
  | -- ...
  ```
  where `...` of course represents the other `.py` files in this repo. Note the folder name `extracted_feature`


`LwP[MAIN].ipynb` is our main file. The file is sufficiently self-contained so far as the project is concerned. Ensure you have `dataset` and `extracted_feature` in the same directory as the `.ipynb`.
